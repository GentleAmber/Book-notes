# Book Notes
Users can sign up and log in with their own accounts. After logging in, they can write book notes, give ratings, add online pics as covers for books, etc.
<br><br>
This website uses PostgreSQL to save user data, [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers) to fetch covers for the books whose serial numbers are provided.

Because of involvement of the database, it can take a while to set up the environment to run this project locally. Instead you can watch the demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFDgva3Vxpw&feature=youtu.be
